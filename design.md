# Design

## Who is the target for this design, e.g., are you assuming any knowledge on the part of the language users?

We are targetting CS5 students with this design. We assume the user has a basic understanding of programming.

## Why did you choose this design, i.e., why did you think it would be a good idea for users to express the maze-searching computation using this syntax?

We chose this design to have a natural way of talking about Picobot.

## What behaviors are easier to express in your design than in Picobot's original design?  If there are no such behaviors, why not?

It is easier to issue complex commands. In this language.


## What behaviors are more difficult to express in your design than in Picobot's original design? If there are no such behaviors, why not?

## On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is "very different"), how different is your syntax from PicoBot's original design?

## Is there anything you don't like about your design?
