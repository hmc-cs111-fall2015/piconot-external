# Evaluation

## Diary

* We implemented everything except for else's. (A problem we ran into when we tried to implement the internal DSL)
* There are currently more seperators than we want in an example program, but we can correct for that after we deal with "else".
* We have a working version with elses... have to use semi-colons to separate each of the states. Trying to remove those, might be harder than we think.
* The semi-colons are gone.
* We were using the text to test our code and now we found out that our set up was incorrect for using JFXApp and the GUIDisplay.
* Fixed the GUIDisplay :-)
* Added some functionality to enable change the maze
* We ran into a strange git divergance and took a while to fix that!!
* Trying to create a prompt for the user to allow them to change the file that is read into the interpreter

## Required Questions
### On a scale of 1â€“10 (where 10 is "a lot"), how much did
you have to change your syntax? 

1-2; we did not have to change very much of our ideal syntax. While we ran into some obstacles with enabling else's and removing semi-colons from the syntax, we were able to implement all the features we were looking for.
